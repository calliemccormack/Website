## Biography

I have a 3.97 GPA and have received many honors from UT, including college scholar, CNS second year excellence award, and most recently I was named an Unrestricted Presidential Endowed Scholar. When I finish my undergraduate degree, I hope to go to graduate school for genetic counseling.
